# VLSI Circuit Design - COMPE 572  
This repository contains my first-semester project at San Diego State University for COMPE 572 - Circuit Design.  

## 📌 Project Overview  
- **Title:** Video Processing System Based on Neural Networks  
- **Tools Used:** Cadence Virtuoso, Xcelium, Verilog HDL  
- **Objective:** Design, implement, and verify a high-performance system with sub-block layouts, DRC/LVS validation, and post-layout simulations.  
- **Key Blocks:** Adder, Multiplier, Color Mapping Block  
- **Verification:** Layout vs. Schematic (LVS), Design Rule Checks (DRC), and post-layout simulations  

## 📁 Project Files  
- 📂 `Project-4 VLSI Ckt Design.pptx` → Final presentation slides  
- 📂 `code/` → Verilog code (Adder, Multiplier, etc.)  
- 📂 `layouts/` → Cadence Virtuoso layout screenshots  
- 📂 `reports/` → Design documentation  

## 🔥 Learning Outcomes  
- Hands-on experience with Cadence tools  
- Implemented schematic-to-layout flow and debugging  
- Improved understanding of CMOS circuit layout  

## 📜 Conclusion  
This project provided practical exposure to VLSI design methodologies and verification techniques, enhancing skills in layout design and post-layout validation.
